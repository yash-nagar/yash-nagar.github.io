I am software developer by profession and a budding data scientist by interest. I am passionate about artificial intelligence, statistics and machine Learning. I consider my self tech savvy, and like to read and keep myself updated with all the new trends in modern technology.

I also have keen interest in Astrophysics and Bollywood. In my free time, you can find me in the nearest sports center or creating beautiful charts with random datasets.
